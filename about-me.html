      <h2 class="about__title">About me</h2>
      <p class="about__text about__text_spot_first">I have been working in design since 1998. My career path, spanning over 2 decades,
         started when the Internet was still in its infancy, and even then, I knew that web and interface design would be something I wanted to pursue professionally.
         Over the years I have gained extensive experience in graphic design, logo and brand identity creation,
          interactive design, advertising, and illustrations, however my main interest has always been gravitating towards interfaces.</p>
      <div class="about__paragraph">
        <p class="about__subtitle">Recent history</p>
        <p class="about__text">For the last 7 years I have been working at Perx, where I lead the design team as Head of Design. At Perx we create unique digital services for the world's leading car manufacturers and dealer networks, helping our clients to become leaders in digital area.
           My role as a Head of Design is to organize all the design related processes, from the idea to final product.</p>
        <p class="about__text">I am directly involved in the development from the very early stage, creating an image of a future product, making structure and user path analysis, as well as prototyping.
          Also, I take part in the UI development of each project, from sketches to the final implementation. In addition, I oversee the work of the design team, combining the roles of supervisor, mentor and "player-coach".</p>

        <p class="about__subtitle">Middle Ages</p>
        <p class="about__text">Prior to Perx, for 3 years I worked as a principal designer and head of design in Adwizard.
           Company provided digital production for international and local advertising agencies and famous brand name clients. My role was to create the principal design for all kinds of projects, as well as setting tasks and providing quality control for the work of external teams.</p>
        <p class="about__text">Before Adwizard, I worked in RBC Soft, internet development department of the most famous Russian business news agency. In a couple of years, I went from a Mid-level Designer to a Senior one, and then headed the Internet department as an Art Director.
           My team have worked for most well-known industrial and financial companies, designing corporate websites, intranet solutions and online stores.</p>

        <p class="about__subtitle">Ancient times</p>
        <p class="about__text">When I worked in Agava (2001 â€” 2004), it was the largest website hosting company in Russia. I ran a web design department that made sites for corporate clients and internal projects. In the course of work, we came up with Webbox system, an effective tool for quickly creating websites using design skins connected to the CMS.
           It was one of the first website builder platforms in Russia that helped Agava attract more customers.</p>
        <p class="about__text">My whole career began in Webmaster Agency, which was one of three companies in Russia that could produce websites in 1998, when the Internet was in its infancy. That's when I started making websites for various companies using only Photoshop and HTML.
           Also, I tried to do some graphic design, logos and illustrations.</p>
